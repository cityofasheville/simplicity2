<p>Buildings are most vulnerable when they're located in 
flood prone areas and don't have an elevated first floor or 
floodproofing that helps them cope with flood waters.
</p>
<p>Commercial and industrial property is especially 
vulnerable in the River Arts District (RAD) and in the area along 
Swannanoa River Road between Biltmore Village and 
Tunnel Road. Some residential properties
in these areas are also vulnerable to flooding.
</p>
<p>Key services are also vulnerable. In particular, 
food locations (including SNAP retailers) and bus routes could be 
impacted, which could result in service interruptions.

export const landslideRiskOverview = `
<p>Properties are most vulnerable when they are in the
pathway of potential slope failures or landslides.
For example, certain properties may be vulnerable in
the Woodfin and Reynolds Mountain area due to the
presence of steep slopes along the US-19 corridor.
</p>
<p>A few residential areas along Town Mountain, in the
Beaverdam neighborhood, and in Reynolds Mountain
are vulnerable to landslides due to homes being on or
adjacent to steep slopes.
</p>
<p>Roads are also vulnerable to slope failures and
landslides. Roads impacted by slope failures could
result in temporary loss of road access, especially
along Town Mountain, in Beaverdam, and in the
Reynolds Mountain area.

export const heatRiskOverview = `
<p>Sensitive populations and households with members 65 and older 
are vulnerable to extreme heat. For example, much of Central Asheville is 
vulnerable to the urban heat island effect, when developed areas 
are hotter than nearby rural areas. This is because of the large amount 
of paved surfaces and reflective buildings and the relatively 
low tree canopy cover.</p>

<p>Homes adjacent to or surrounded by fuels and vegetation are vulnerable to wildfire, especially
in areas with steep slopes and where fire response may be more challenging.
