            <p>
              Our community is unusual for its high concentration of homeless Veterans, while we have fewer than average families with children compared to other cities in NC. Addressing the challenges of homelessness effectively requires understanding the particular needs of particular subpopulations. Our <a className="inText" href="http://www.ashevillenc.gov/civicax/filebank/blobdload.aspx?blobid=27777" target="_blank">Five Year Strategic Plan</a> focuses on the two largest sub-populations in Buncombe County: homeless Veterans and those defined as chronically homeless by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

                <strong>Chronically Homeless</strong>: As defined since January 15, 2016, a person who is chronically homeless is one who lives in a place not meant for human habitation or in an emergency shelter and has been homeless as described continuously for at least 12 months or on at least four separate occasions in the last 3 years meets that description, as long as the combined occasions total at least 12 months and have a disability (42 U.S.C. 11360(9)). In the past 10 years, there have been several changes to the definition of chronically homeless by US Department of Housing and Urban Devlopment (HUD).

              The graphs on this page reflect the literally homeless as defined by HUD. The Public education systems operate under a different definition of homelessness that includes individuals who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence. This includes what is commonly referred to as ‘doubled-up’ – 2 or more families living in the same unit, often because of economic hardship. The public school systems track this data for the community and it can be viewed at the following links: <a href="http://www.ashevillecityschools.net/pages/Asheville_City_Schools/Student_Services/Education_for_Homeless_Childre" target="_blank" className="inText">Asheville City Schools homelessness information</a> and <a href="https://buncombeschools.org/cms/One.aspx?portalId=92531&pageId=255538" target="_blank" className="inText">Buncombe County Schools homelessness information</a>.

              The &quot;Household with only children&quot; category was introduced in the 2011 PIT Count. Prior to 2011, these households were included in the &quot;Households without Dependent Children&quot; household type (now called &quot;Households without Children&quot;).
