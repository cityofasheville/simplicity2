          they qualify for and that facilities their specific needs. For Veterans who decline an
          intervention, the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness benchmarks require that a
          documented offer of a housing intervention be made to that Veteran every two weeks. These
          persons are listed as ‘declining’ on the Veteran By-Name list for Buncombe County.

                    The Veteran Administration offers community-based grants through the Supportive
                    Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) Program, which provides supportive services
                    to very low-income Veteran families in or transitioning to permanent housing.
                    Funds are granted to private non-profit organizations and consumer cooperatives
                    who assist very low-income Veteran families by providing a range of supportive
                    services designed to promote housing stability. Grantees provide eligible
                    Veteran families with outreach, case management, and assistance in obtaining VA
                    and other benefits to support housing stability.

                  <div>
                    a collaborative program between US Department of Housing and Urban Development
                    (HUD) and the VA which combines HUD housing vouchers with VA supportive services
                    to help Veterans who are homeless and their families find and sustain permanent
                    housing. Through public housing authorities, HUD provides rental assistance
                    vouchers for privately owned housing to Veterans who are eligible for VA health
                    care services and are experiencing homelessness. VA case managers may connect
                    these Veterans with support services such as health care, mental health
                    treatment and substance use counseling to help them in their recovery process
                    and with their ability to maintain housing in the community.

                    Since 1994, the VA's Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Program (GPD) has
                    offered Veterans Affairs Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) Programs to
                    community agencies providing services to homeless Veterans. The purpose of GPD
                    is to promote the development and provision of supportive housing and/or
                    supportive services with the goal of helping homeless Veterans achieve
                    residential stability, increase their skill levels and/or income, and obtain
                    greater self-determination. In 2017, the VA designated several program types
                    within GPD: Healthcare to Home, Low Barrier, Clinical, Bridge Housing and
                    Service-Intensive Transitional Housing (SITH). Whereas most GPD programs provide
                    short lengths of stay in transitional housing facilities and provide rapid
                    connections to permanent housing, SITH provides up to 24 months of transitional
                    housing in which homeless Veterans are actively working with the assistance of
                    appropriate services and supports to achieve permanent housing. In Buncombe
                    County, Veterans are offered a choice at identification as to whether a housing
                    intervention or a Grant and Per Diem program meets their needs.
