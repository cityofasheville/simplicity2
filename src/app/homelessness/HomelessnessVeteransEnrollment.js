        <h3>Veterans on the by-name list</h3>
        <div>
          The Veteran By-Name List is a comprehensive list of homeless Veterans in the community
          that is populated through information from street and VA outreach, HMIS, community
          shelters, VA-funded programs including GPD providers, and any other provider who may work
          with Veterans experiencing homelessness. The list is updated regularly – in most cases,
          daily – in order to ensure it has the most up-to-date information.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          A by-name is not a waiting list – Veterans on this list may already be accessing programs,
          waiting for a housing unit, have entered a transitional program, declined assistance or
          may self-resolve their homelessness. The by-name list is used to determine where Veterans
          actually are in our homeless assistance system, who needs to be prioritized for services
          and/or housing and what barriers need to be removed.

                    A facility that’s primary purpose is to provide temporary shelter for the
                    general homeless population or those that serve a specific client base such as
                    Domestic Violence victims or youth under 18 years of age.

                    Once a Veteran has been identified, a determination is made as to eligibility
                    for VA programs and the Veteran is offered a choice for a housing intervention.
                    If no immediate bed is available in the non-clinical GPD program, the Veteran
                    moves to an intake bed until a GPD bed is available. The Veteran may elect to
                    enroll in a housing program and enter GPD for a short duration (Bridge Housing)
                    while housing is located or enter the long term service intensive transitional
                    program.

                    This category covers Veterans that have been outreached, identified and placed
                    on the by-name list but who may be temporarily in an institutional setting like
                    an inpatient treatment center or hospital or detained in the local jail so they
                    cannot be fully engaged in housing related services until current issue is
                    resolved.

                  </div>
                  <div>
                    If a Veteran on the active by-name list can no longer be located after repeated
                    attempts, the Veteran’s status is then changed from “active” to “missing in
                    action” and after 90 days or more, are then removed from the list for purposes
                    of calculating these benchmarks. If the Veteran is located at a later date and
                    is still experiencing homelessness, the date of the most recent contact becomes
                    the new date of identification.

                    Since 1994, the VA's Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Program (GPD) has
                    offered Veterans Affairs Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) Programs to
                    community agencies providing services to homeless Veterans. The purpose of GPD
                    is to promote the development and provision of supportive housing and/or
                    supportive services with the goal of helping homeless Veterans achieve
                    residential stability, increase their skill levels and/or income, and obtain
                    greater self-determination. In 2017, the VA designated several program types
                    within GPD: Healthcare to Home, Low Barrier, Clinical, Bridge Housing and
                    Service-Intensive Transitional Housing (SITH). Whereas most GPD programs provide
                    short lengths of stay in transitional housing facilities and provide rapid
                    connections to permanent housing, SITH provides up to 24 months of transitional
                    housing in which homeless Veterans are actively working with the assistance of
                    appropriate services and supports to achieve permanent housing. In Buncombe
                    County, Veterans are offered a choice at identification as to whether a housing
                    intervention or a Grant and Per Diem program meets their needs.
